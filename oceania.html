<h2>Australia</h2>
<p>Photo credits - &copy; Iborisoff</p>
<p>Australia, the smallest continent and one of the largest countries on Earth, 
    lying between the Pacific and Indian oceans in the Southern Hemisphere. 
    Australia’s capital is Canberra, located in the southeast between the larger and more important economic and cultural centres of Sydney and Melbourne.
    Australia has been called “the Oldest Continent,” “the Last of Lands,” and “the Last Frontier.”
    The most striking characteristics of the vast country are its global isolation, 
    its low relief, and the aridity of much of its surface

        <p>New Zealand, Glow worms can be found throughout the country, and are often spotted in damp, overgrown places – the banks of lakes, rivers and forest undergrowth are prime places to spot their glowing blue-green lights. 
             Guided night time kayaking, hiking or boating trips are great ways to get to the right places to see them.
             New Zealand is a land of great contrasts and diversity. 
             Active volcanoes, spectacular caves, deep glacier lakes, verdant valleys, dazzling fjords, long sandy beaches, 
             and the spectacular snowcapped peaks of the Southern Alps on the South Island—all contribute to New Zealand’s scenic beauty.
