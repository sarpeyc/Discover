<p>The Tiger’s Nest Monastery is a sacred Buddhist site located near Paro, Bhutan. It was constructed in 1692, around the cave where Guru Rinpoche first meditated, the event that introduced Buddhism into Bhutan. There is a legend that Guru Rinpoche was carried from Tibet to this location on the back of a tigress, thus giving it the name “Tiger’s Nest”.Now, this monastery consists of four temples with residential accommodations for the monks. Despite the daily visits by tourists, Paro Takstang still functions as a monastery today. Due to its location, the only way to get to the monastery is by hiking. There are no vehicles that make the drive up to the monastery. However, for those who cannot hike the entire way, you can hire a horse to carry you most of the way there.

    <p>Lijiang is a beautifully preserved ancient Chinese town, infused with cultural flavor. Strolling along the 800-year-old bridges and waterways of the world-famous Old Town district is like stepping back in time. Its architecture is noteworthy for the blending of elements from several cultures that have come together over many centuries. Lijiang also possesses an ancient water-supply system of great complexity and ingenuity that still functions effectively today. The mountains in the surrounding area of the Old Town of Lijiang have been well preserved, and the time-honored water-supply system is still functioning today. The property boundaries and buffer zone are in the process of being modified to better protect the outstanding universal value of the property.

        <p>Volcanoes are the center of folklore and myth wherever they exist. These fiery mountains prone to unexpectedly erupting in cascades of lava and ash have inspired and frightened humans for centuries. However, there is one volcano that has a reputation that surpasses all others, Indonesia’s Kawah Ijen volcano, otherwise known as the blue volcano.The phenomenon is caused when the volcano's sulfuric gases come into contact with air temperature above 360°C. The Ijen volcano complex has some of the highest levels of sulfur in the world. This dense collection of the gas, when exposed to oxygen and lit by the molten hot lava burns blue. Unlike regular volcanoes whose bright red lava is visible in the day, Kawah Ijen’s blue burning flames can only be seen at night.

        <p>It’s hard to think of Malaysia and not visualise gorgeous, tropical beaches. In fact, I think most people planning a trip to this part of the world are going to want to include at least one of these Malaysia beach holiday destinations during their time in the country. Most of Malaysia’s best beaches are located on the many islands that dot its coast and this can be a great option. Most islands are easy to reach and the most popular ones, Penang and Langkawi, even have international airports so you can fly right in and be at one of the best beach destinations in Malaysia within an hour of arriving in the country.

        <p>The Gardens by the Bay is a nature park spanning 101 hectares in the Central Region of Singapore, adjacent to the Marina Reservoir. The park consists of three waterfront gardens: Bay South Garden (in Marina South), Bay East Garden (in Marina East) and Bay Central Garden (in Downtown Core and Kallang).The largest of the gardens is the Bay South Garden at 54 hectares designed by Grant Associates. Its Flower Dome is the largest glass greenhouse in the world. Gardens by the Bay was part of the nation's plans to transform its "Garden City" to a "City in a Garden", with the aim of raising the quality of life by enhancing greenery and flora in the city. First announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at Singapore's National Day Rally in 2005, Gardens by the Bay was intended to be Singapore's premier urban outdoor recreation space, and a national icon. Being one of the popular tourist attractions in Singapore, the park received 6.4 million visitors in 2014, while topping its 20 millionth visitor mark in November 2015 and over 50 million in 2018.
