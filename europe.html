Finland is known for nature's most spectacular light show, the Aurora Borealis,commonly known as the Northern Lights. It is in the centre of the "Aurora Zone" which means any further north, or any further south, the chances of seeing the Northern Lights aren’t as good. It's position being inland also reduces the chances of coming across coastal fog that would obstruct the veiw of the Northern Light.
