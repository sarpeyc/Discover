    The Perito Moreno Glacier, named for a 19th-century explorer, is currently 19 miles long and rises an average height of 240 feet above the water. 
    Altogether, the glacier covers about 121 square miles.
    It is part of an ice field located in both Argentina and Chile that is the third largest reserve of fresh water in the world.
    If you wait for a while, you’ll likely witness huge chunks of the ice mass fracture off and crash into the water, creating a massive, reverberating roar. 
    There are walking paths that allow you to check out the glacier from a few different vantage points,
     as well as a boat that takes you on a 45-minute trip around the base. There are also trekking tours that take you out to walk on parts of the glacier itself, 
    surrounded by the beautiful Patagonian scenery of forests and mountains.

    <p>Bolivia, country of west-central South America. Extending some 950 miles 1,500 km north-south and 800 miles east-west,
         Bolivia is bordered to the north and east by Brazil, to the southeast by Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest and west by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. 
         Bolivia shares Lake Titicaca, the second largest lake in South America.Bolivia is traditionally regarded as a highland country. 
         Although only one-third of its territory lies in the Andes Mountains,
          most of the nation’s largest cities are located there, and for centuries the highlands have attracted the nation’s largest amount of mining, commercial, and business investment.

        <p>Brazil,Iguazu falls is One of the most unique waterfalls on the planet, and now one of the most famous, was created when an enormous volcanic eruption created a huge crack in the earth, 
            which creates the incredible spectacle as the Paraná River runs off it.
            To put in perspective the enormity of this volcanic crack,
             Iguazu Falls is not only 31 meters (102 feet) taller at the highest points,
             than the more famous Niagara Falls, but it is also twice as wide!
             As mentioned before, the river is always gushing so there is no fear of witnessing a dry falls, however there is a good and bad time to visit the falls. 
             The winters in this area of Brazil are never cold, 
             but the water level can be considerably lower than other seasons, and summer can be unbearably humid, 
             so it is recommended to visit in the tranquil seasons of fall, or spring.

        <p>Caño Cristales in the Colombian National Park of La Macarena has been called the most beautiful river in the world, and the river than escaped from heaven, because of its incredible red colour. 
            It is one of Colombia’s most unique and exciting tourist attractions.However, for a brief period of time every year, the river blossoms in a vibrant explosion of colors. 
            During the short span between the wet and dry seasons, when the water level is just right, a unique species of plant that lines the river floor called Macarenia clavigera turns a brilliant red. 
            It is offset by splotches of yellow and green sand, blue water, and a thousand shades in between.
            In spite of that, there is a lot more to see and do on a tour to Caño Cristales than just seeing the red river. The river itself is located alongside the huge La Macarena National Park, which is a vast area home to savannahs,
             incredible rock formations, jungles and bird and mammal watching.

        <p>The Swing At The End Of The World or La Casa del Arbol is a charming swing located on top of a mountain alongside the Tungurahua volcano.
           This swing was originally set up by a local in charge of monitoring the seismic activity of the Tungurahua volcano for potential eruptions.
            He set up this swing for himself to enjoy but soon it became extremely popular for its picturesque location.
            This swing is very famous and recognizable because it hangs down a lush tree with a beautiful wooden treehouse next to it.
            La Casa Del Arbol earned its nickname as The Swing At The End Of The World because from the right angle it looks like you’re swinging into nowhere with a giant drop off beneath you.
